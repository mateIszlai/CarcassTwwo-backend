# Introduction 
TODO: Give a short introduction of your project. Let this section explain the objectives or the motivation behind this project. 

# Getting Started
Carcasstwwo is an online implementation of the famous boardgame Carcassonne. Carcassonne is a tile-placement game in which the players draw and place a tile with a piece of southern French landscape on it. The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of their meeples on one of the areas on it. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.

# About the Project
This Project was a team exercise during my studies at Codecool. The task was to create an online carcassonne, which you can play with other players. We achieved this buy creating a real-time web application, where you can create and join lobbies.

The application's frontend can be found here on GitHub: https://github.com/abelHodasz/carcasstwwo-react
